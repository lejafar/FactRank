FactRank identifies these claims in transcripts of parliamentary debates and other Dutch-language texts. FactRank is however **not** an automatic fact-checker – whether the identified claims are true or false, or something in between, has to be determined by a fact-check.


You can also <b-link to="/demo">enter your own text</b-link> in order to have FactRank search it for claims that are factual and
check-worthy.

if you have feedback, we’d love to hear from you. Send an email to <a href="mailto:factrank@gmail.com?Subject=Feedback" target="_top">factrank@gmail.com</a> and help fight disinformation.
